Use &#123;line&#125;gg to go to a specific line. Use G to go to the end of the file. Type % jump to matching (&#123;[]&#125;). undo and redo u to undo ctrl+r to redo delete dd for delete line D for delete line from the cursor d{motion} - delete text covered by motion d2w =&gt; deletes two words dt; =&gt; delete until ; d/hello =&gt; delete until hello dd - delete line x delete at cursor d0 delete to start of line d$ delete to end of line d) delete to end of sentence dgg delete to start of file dG delete to end of file change change and insert example 123// d + i=&gt; wdtSipolite&lt;ESC&gt;fcdwipolitely&lt;ESPACE&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;// c =&gt; wctSpolite&lt;ESC&gt;fccwpolitely&lt;ESPACE&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;const politeSalute = &quot;I politely salute you good person.&quot;; cc change entire line C changes from the cursor until the end of the line dot repeat last change ci directly change text objects from anywhere of the line ciw cis cip ci&quot; also, ci{ or ci( can be applied 123456789101112 |- `a` means around |- `i` means inner / / /&#123;a|i&#125;&#123;text-object&#125; / / | w - word | s - sentence | p - paragraph | &quot; - quotes Other Operators In addition to d and c these are other useful operators: y (yank): Copy in Vim jargon p (put): Paste in Vim jargon g~ (switch case): Changes letters from lowercase to uppercase and back. Alternatively, use gu to make something lowercase and gU to make something uppercase &gt; (shift right): Adds indentation &lt; (shift left): Removes indentation = (format code): Formats code y and p is how you copy and paste things in Vim. Like d and c, y can be combined with motions and text objects to copy any text that you desire: More Short-hand Operators x is equivalent to dl and deletes the character under the cursor X is equivalent to dh and deletes the character before the cursor s is equivalent to ch, deletes the character under the cursor and puts you into Insert mode r allows you to replace one single character for another. Very handy to fix typos. ~ to switch case for a single character A nice way use case for x is to swap a couple of characters when you make a typo. You remove (and cut) a character with x and immediately paste it after the cursor with p.
